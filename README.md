This is the project for the lab sessions of the TCS1-IN Algorithms &
Programming course (Rust track). The project is updated before each lab
session.

Solutions for selected exercises of session `MXX` will be given in the
corresponding `MXX-sol` directory. You should read the
`MXX-sol/comments.md` file explaining solutions (view it directly
through https://gitlab.isae-supaero.fr).
