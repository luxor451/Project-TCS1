//! This project, since it is in Rust, does not respect completly the struture given in the subject
//! To use prim's algorithme, you should use the main i.e. run 'cargo run --release --bin projet -- filename'
//! This will display in the terminal the maze generated with prim_naive and prim_bh, the maze should not be too big to fit in the terminal
//! The maze generated by prim_bh will also be written in the pbm file
//!
//! For the tests use 'cargo test' they are located in the different files as private modules
//! To note : the test for heap_complexity, given it's runtime is ignored by 'cargo test', you can
//! still run it manually with 'cargo test heap_complexity -- --ignored' , it is located in the binary_heap.rs file
//!
//! In find_neighors is implemented the find_neighbors function but most of the actual computation is in the module Neighbors
//!
//! For the prim_bh function, to change the cost of a node I choose to insert a new node and keep an Vec
//! giving if we have already visited the node or not
