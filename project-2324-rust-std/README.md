This project since it is in Rust does not respect completly the struture given in the subject
To use prim's algorithme, you should use the main i.e. run "cargo run --bin projet -- filename"
This will display in the terminal the maze generated with prim_naive

For the tests use "cargo test"

In core.rs is implemented all the different struct with their implementation and formating functions
In find_neighors is implemented the find_neighbors function but most of it is the module Neighbors
