## Before all : run the "cargo doc --open" command to generate the documentation and open the index.html file in your browser

I would recommend looking at the source code in rustdoc because I find that all the exemples for the different function make the code not really readable in VScode.

Finnaly I was not able to compile and test the doctests and thus they may be typo or mistakes in the exemples given 

This project, since it is in Rust, does not respect completly the struture given in the subject.

To use prim's algorithme, you should use the main i.e. run 'cargo run --release --bin projet -- filename'
This will display in the terminal the maze generated with prim_naive and prim_bh, the maze should not be too big to fit in the terminal.

The maze generated by prim_bh will also be written in the pbm file.
For the tests use 'cargo test' they are located in the different files as private modules.
To note : the test for heap_complexity, given it's runtime is ignored by 'cargo test', you can
still run it manually with 'cargo test heap_complexity -- --ignored' , it is located in the binary_heap.rs file.

In find_neighors is implemented the find_neighbors function but most of the actual computation is in the module Neighbors

For the prim_bh function, to change the cost of a node I choose to insert a new node and keep an Vec
giving if we have already visited the node or not
